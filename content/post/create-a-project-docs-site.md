It's just as easy to create a Project-based docs site with Github Pages and Hugo.  Following the guidance in my [first post](../creating-a-blog-with-hugo.md), there are just a few modifications we'll need to make.

The URL for your project will be `https://<USERNAME|ORGANIZATION>.github.io/<PROJECT>/`

In the root of your Github project run `hugo new site .` This will create the project scafflolding.

Follow the same instructions for creating a Github-hosted Blog page:
* Adding a Github actions config file
* Add in a cool theme you
* Create some content to describe your project
